# BigData analysis using hadoop:

This is my personal experience repository on hadoop. I made this when I started working with hadoop at my college during my 3rd year.

This repository contains all my previous experiences with hadoop and big data.
"cfg" file contains several scripts that I wrote to make installation of hadoop easy.
"hadoop-streaming" file contains a utility that I used to write hadoop programs in python rather than in java.
All other directories are various projects that I've worked with. Most of them are log files,website dumps,store dumps and business data.
	
Refer "Hadoop_Report" file for further descriptions.
